## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm currently a junior student at Davidson College. 
My majors are Computer Science and Philosophy. 
I like machine learning since it uses data to help people solve many practical problems in NLP, medical diagnosis and treatment.

## Package

Most of my Machine Learning(ML) projects are installed with sklearn, a useful ML package. 

```bash
  import sklearn
```
